# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  To take an object and turn it into smaller, easier to handle ( and read with our human optic receptors) variables for later use. 
  
  Researched answer:
  "In JavaScript, destructuring is when you decompose the properties of an object or the indexes of an array to separate them to create specific variables. This does not mean that these separated objects or arrays can never be used again in the program."

2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer:
  Value, index and the array its mapping. 

  Researched answer:
  "The value of the element, the index of the element, and the array object being mapped. If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as callback's this value. Otherwise, the value undefined will be used as its this value"


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  A class is kind of like a template child to the parent object, allowing it to define the properties of the parent.

  Researched answer:
  "Classes and objects from the essential part of Object-oriented programming, where a class can be considered as a construct that encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class."


4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer:
  Generally, a div tag is used for layout placement and containing large blocks of data. 
  Span is used for smaller data, much like a paragraph tag or h1 that will only hold a small snippit of data.

  Researched answer:
  "The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code."

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer:
  Honestly, I'm drawing a blank. I dont think we covered it a whole lot and ontop of that, I dont feel secure in my React knowledge at all. Error 500. Proceeding to reteach myself in my research and extended study of React. 
  
  Researched answer:
  "A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM."
  While my researched study on this produced the above answer straight from React's website, I don't feel like this is really taking hold with me, but thats due to my unease with React. I'm currently taking an extra Udemy and a Codecademy course on React to suppliment my study.  
  

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  1: Media queries.
  2: Using css class atributes such as flex, and margin. 
  3: Individual stylesheets that can be loaded upon identification of device type.
  
  Researched answer:
  "Responsive website design consists of the following three main components:
  Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
  Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
  Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes."



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming
  A type of programming that allows developers to define data type of a specific data structure, along with its functions. 
  Its.. kind of hard to explain in just a sentance or two. 

- irb
  Interactive Ruby, a program that will show the results of any Ruby statement. You run it in the terminal. 

- Instance variable
  A type of variable, starting with the @ symbol. You'd use this to store data, or from what I can tell, properties of an object. 

- Ruby hash
  Similar to an array, a hash is a collection of key and value pairs

- Class relationships
Ah, boy, so reading on this isnt a simple as a few words here to easily explain what class relationships are. They appear to be a way to define some attributes to link one thing kind of like children of a parent object. For instance, Andee owns a cofee mug with some cool design on them and what they are used for, but he doesnt just own a single coffee mug, he also owns a lot of different coffee mugs with a lot of different attributes, so I'd have to link them all up to the class of Andee and those cups to him.. all with class relationships. 

My brain hurt. 


//Side question here - would it be helpful if I linked to the source of my researched answers so that you can see if i'm learning the right thing? For instance, if I looked at research for .map() I could possibly be looking at .map() (like an idiot) in python instead, and because those two things are not exactly the same, I might be teaching myself the wrong thing. It could provide you an opportunity to correct my understanding If I were to make that kind of false distinction. Idk, just an idea.
